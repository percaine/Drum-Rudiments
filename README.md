# Drum-Rudiments
I'm a new drummer and I wanted to learn rudiments with some feedback but I couldn't find free software so I made my own.
This is drum rudiments software with hit detection and midi drum support.
The standalone version is only available as an appimage for linux but it can be used in the chrome browser as well.
It has midi drum support and hit detection so you can tell if you are playing to fast or too slow.
The software is a work in progress and I had help with the code from various Ai coding sites as I'm not a coder.
The hit detection is really only useful for single strokes and like I said it's a work in progress so it may not 
work 100% perfect but it's working decent.

The interface has a metronome with a slider to adjust the tempo and a long press on the number makes it so you can 
input a bpm number yourself.
You can also map your drums in case the default mappings don't match your drum kit.
The Performance tracker is probably not 100% accurate so take that with a grain of salt.
